# Defender explosion project

This project is inspired from the code published in Wireframe #1 (see original 
project) Source Code: The genius behind Defender's explosions, pages 32-33. 
The code example was created by Daniel Pope, and the comments were created by Simon Long.

The current version extracts the explosion into a function for better reading.
